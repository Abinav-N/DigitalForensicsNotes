I’m checking the workspace for `mob.txt` and any `.txt` files to locate the target. If it’s not present, I’ll ask you to provide the file or confirm the intended source.

### Mobile Forensics – Guided Notes (Easy-to-Understand, Markdown)

#### What you’ll learn
- Stages and practical methods of mobile acquisition and analysis
- Android fundamentals: ADB, rooting, extraction methods
- iOS fundamentals: boot modes, jailbreak implications, backups
- Advanced techniques: JTAG, Chip-Off, Micro-read
- Challenges and best practices

---

### Acquisition Protocol (Do this first)
- Handle with gloves; preserve fingerprints.
- Document on-scene state: open apps, notifications, clipboard.
- Isolate from networks using a Faraday bag.
- Record identifiers in chain of custody: device model, IMEI, serial, SIM, OS, owner.
- If present, ask the owner for passcode/pattern (encryption often blocks access).
- If passcode unknown: consider lawful bypass approaches; note tool usage and risks.

---

### Legal Note: Biometrics and Self-Incrimination
- A U.S. District Court (N. California) held suspects cannot be compelled to unlock devices using Face ID/Touch ID even with a warrant.
- Investigators instead sought data from service providers (e.g., Facebook Messenger).
- Always get appropriate legal authorization; understand local jurisdiction rules.

---

### Android Basics
- Android is Linux-based; apps run in a VM environment (Dalvik/ART) with permission controls.
- Common file systems: YAFFS2 (older), ext2/ext3/ext4, vfat.
- Typical evidence: CDRs, contacts, SMS/MMS, app data, GPS, Wi‑Fi, passwords.

---

### Rooting (What and Why)
- Grants superuser access to protected areas of the device.
- Pros: access system files, remove bloatware, better battery, install special apps.
- Cons: risk of bricking, reduced security, void warranty, modifies evidence state.
- Important: Evidence gathered via rooting may be challenged for admissibility. Prefer methods that minimize alteration.

---

### Android Debug Bridge (ADB)
- Components: Client (your terminal), Daemon on device (adbd), Server on host.
- Common uses: install/uninstall apps, list devices, open shell, port forwarding.

```bash
# List devices
adb devices

# Install / uninstall apps
adb install filename.apk
adb uninstall package.name

# Open device shell and escalate (if rooted)
adb shell
su
```

---

### Screen Lock Bypass (Android/iOS)
- Commercial tools: dr.fone – unlock, iSkysoft Toolbox, Pangu FPR Unlocker, etc. 
  - Pros: high success rate, low data loss
  - Cons: licensing, model/OS support varies
- Flashing custom recovery/ROM (e.g., TWRP, Clockwork)
  - Risky: model-specific, can destroy data or brick device
  - Note: No write-blockers in mobile forensics; document every change.

---

### Acquisition Methods

#### 1) Manual Extraction (Non-invasive, Quick Wins)
- Tool example: AFLogical OSE (NowSecure)
- Process:
  1. Push and install `AFLogical-OSE_1.5.2.apk` via ADB/USB/OTG
  2. Launch the app; select data categories; capture
  3. Retrieve exports from `sdcard/forensics/` (CSV for calls, contacts, messages; XML info)
- Use CSVs in your analysis suite; preserves time.

```bash
adb devices
adb -d install AFLogical-OSE_1.5.2.apk
# After capture in-app, pull files if needed:
adb pull /sdcard/forensics ./extraction-output
```

#### 2) Physical Acquisition (dd over ADB/Netcat)
- Tools: BusyBox, Netcat (Ncat), `dd`, rooting tool (e.g., KingoRoot)
- High-level steps:
  1. Install ADB drivers and required APKs (rooting + BusyBox)
  2. Root device (e.g., KingoRoot), confirm `su` available
  3. `adb shell` → `su` → list partitions: `cat /proc/partitions`
  4. Port forward: `adb forward tcp:8888 tcp:8888`
  5. On device, stream image:
     - `dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0 | busybox nc -l -p 8888`
  6. On host, receive image:
     - `nc 127.0.0.1 8888 > android.dd`
  7. Verify and analyze (e.g., Autopsy)

```bash
# Host side
adb devices
adb -d install KingoRoot.apk
adb -d install BusyBox.apk
adb shell
su
cat /proc/partitions

# Host: forward a local port to device
adb forward tcp:8888 tcp:8888

# Device shell (via adb):
dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0 | busybox nc -l -p 8888

# Host: receive stream to file
nc 127.0.0.1 8888 > android.dd
```

- Notes:
  - `mmcblk0` is often the physical disk; confirm exact target.
  - Imaging time depends on device storage size.
  - Document every action. Expect admissibility scrutiny due to rooting.

#### 3) JTAG (Advanced, Non-invasive Hardware Interface)
- Concept: Tap the Test Access Port (TAP) to read raw data from the board.
- Steps: identify TAPs → solder/jig → connect emulator → acquire dump → reassemble → analyze.
- Pros: works on many models; less invasive than Chip-Off
- Cons: encrypted devices reduce success; resources can be scarce

#### 4) Chip-Off (Last Resort)
- Concept: De-solder memory chip; read on specialized hardware; get full binary image.
- Pros: works on damaged/bricked devices; high acquisition probability if locked
- Cons: heat/adhesive may damage board; reassembly hard; specialized skills/tools required

#### 5) Micro-read (Highly Specialized)
- Concept: Electron microscope reads chip at gate level in shaved layers, bit by bit.
- Use: rare, expensive; reserved for high‑value cases; limited commercial tooling.

---

### Challenges in Mobile Forensics
- Rapid OS evolution breaks tool compatibility.
- Hardware diversity (connectors, chipsets) complicates access.
- Strong encryption by default; bypass may be impossible without credentials.
- Data off-device in cloud services; requires credentials or provider cooperation.
- Advanced methods (JTAG/Chip-Off/Micro-read) are invasive, costly, and specialized.

---

### iOS Fundamentals

#### Security & Architecture
- Integrated hardware/software/services with security at rest and in transit enabled by default.
- For investigators, closed ecosystem limits generic techniques.

#### Boot Modes
- Normal: Bootrom verifies LLB → verifies iBoot → verifies and runs kernel (all signed).
- Recovery Mode: Bootrom verifies iBoot; iTunes sends signed kernel+ramdisk; no unsigned code.
- DFU Mode: Bootrom loads iBSS (signed); then signed kernel+restore disk; no unsigned code.

#### Jailbreak vs No Jailbreak
- Jailbreak: removes software restrictions; root access; can install tools (OpenSSH, Netcat, Terminal).
- Jailed: only App Store apps; limited investigator options.
- Forensics: jailbroken devices are easier to access; DFU is used in some jailbreak workflows.

#### File System and Partitions
- Text states: HFSX (case-sensitive).
- Logical partitions:
  - System partition (OS components)
  - Data partition (user data: calls, contacts, SMS, emails, media)

#### iTunes/iCloud Backups
- iTunes creates device backups; can be encrypted.
- Unencrypted backups are easier to parse; encrypted backups may require password recovery.

---

### iOS Case Workflows (Tools Cited)

- iPhone Backup Extractor
  - Select backup; if encrypted, recover password; preview and export photos, messages, WhatsApp, call history, contacts; view device info.

- Dr. Fone – iPhone Backup Viewer
  - Recover from iTunes/iCloud backup; preview images, WhatsApp chats, call history; also offers unlock/erase/transfer features.

---

### Quick Reference

- ADB essentials:
  - `adb devices`
  - `adb install <apk>`
  - `adb uninstall <package>`
  - `adb shell` → `su`
  - `adb forward tcp:8888 tcp:8888`

- Manual extraction output:
  - CSVs: calls, contacts, SMS
  - XML: device/app info
  - Location: `sdcard/forensics/`

- Physical imaging stream:
  - Device: `dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0 | busybox nc -l -p 8888`
  - Host: `nc 127.0.0.1 8888 > android.dd`

---

### Best Practices
- Prefer least-invasive methods first (manual, logical) before physical/advanced.
- Preserve and document original state; photograph screens; timestamp actions.
- Avoid rooting unless necessary; justify and document when you do.
- Verify integrity of images (hashing) and maintain chain of custody.
- Cross‑validate evidence across sources (device, backups, provider data).
- Keep toolchains updated; test lab processes on sacrificial devices/VMs.
